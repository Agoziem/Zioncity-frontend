# Workflow Documentation

## Import Dependencies
The code begins by importing necessary dependencies such as React components, context providers, icons, stylesheets, custom hooks, and utility functions.

## Function Component
The `Page` component is defined as a functional component using the arrow function syntax.

## Context Usage
The component utilizes context providers (`SchoolContext` and `TeacherContext`) to access school and teacher data.

## State Initialization
Several state variables are initialized using the `useState` hook to manage terms, results, computed results, class result credentials, and loading states.

## Fetch Terms
An effect hook is used to fetch terms for the school from an API endpoint when the component mounts. The fetched terms are stored in the `terms` state variable.

## Local Storage Handling
The `useLocalStorage` hook is used to persist class result credentials in the local storage. The stored credentials are retrieved and set to the `classresultcredential` state variable.

## Data Preparation
School sessions, school ID, class ID, and school terms are extracted from the context data when available.

## Update Credentials
An effect hook is used to update the class result credentials whenever the school ID or class ID changes.

## Fetch Results
Another effect hook triggers the `fetchResults` function when all necessary class result credentials are available. This function sends a POST request to retrieve results from an API endpoint based on the provided credentials.

## Compute Results
After fetching results, another effect hook computes the results using the `classResulthandler` utility function. The computed results are stored in the `computedResults` state variable.

## Publish Results
A function named `handlePublishResults` sends a POST request to publish the computed results to an API endpoint when the "Publish Results" button is clicked.

## Render Components
The component renders UI elements including a page title, buttons, a datatable component (`Datatable`), and a form component (`ClassResultcredentials`) for inputting class result credentials.

## Pass Props
Props such as loading states, terms, sessions, and form handlers are passed to child components.

## Documentation
The code is documented with comments to explain the purpose of each section and function.

Overall, the workflow of the code involves fetching data, managing state, handling local storage, computing results, and rendering UI components based on the fetched data and user interactions.
